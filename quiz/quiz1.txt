1. What is "state" in React?
D) A lifecycle method

2. Which hook is used to add state in a functional component?
C) useState

3. What does useState return?
C) An array with value and setter function

4. When state changes, what happens?
B) Component re-renders

5. Is state mutable directly in React?
A) Yes

6. What is wrong in this code?
Ans. We are not using setCount to mutate the state. Yes you can change the value but react will not react on this because it does not have context.

7. What is the correct way to increase count by 1?
Ans. setCount(count + 1);

8. If you call setCount(5), will React update immediately?
Ans. No 

9. Why is this better in some cases?
setCount(prev => prev + 1);
Ans. In this case state will be updated immediately instead of waiting for component lifecycle finish.

10. How do you update an object state properly?
const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: "John", age: 25 });
Ans. {
    setUser({...user, age : 26})
}

11. Is it better to keep unrelated data in separate state variables?
Ans. Yes

12. What is derived state?
Ans. B) State calculated from another state

13. Should we store this in state?
A) Yes
Because react does not have context if fullName value is changed

14. What problem can happen if you update state inside another state setter without care?
Ans. We can be stuck in infinite loop. For example useEffect will be stuck in loop if use it badly

15. When should you prefer useReducer over useState?
B) For complex state logic
Ans. I think the best case is where we have related data of state in that case useReducer is a game changer.
    Like if want to use it for change the value in an object. Make todo apps, make counter. Auth. So much useful

16. What are the 3 main parts of useReducer?
Ans.1 useReducer return two things : current value (state), and calling functions or cases in reducer (dispatch)
    2. useReducer takes two parameters. reducer function, current value
    3. reducer function can mutate the state according to dispatch 
    4. useReducer is useful for handling complex state management

17. In reducer function, what must you always return?
Ans. B) Updated state

18. What is "lifting state up"?
Ans. I don't know. Heard first time.

19. Does updating state inside useEffect cause re-render?
A) Yes

20. What is the main difference between useState and useRef regarding re-rendering?
Ans.
    1. useState is used for storing and changing the state value.
    2. useState is triggers re render.
    
    1. useRef is used for getting the reference of input element. Like document.getElementById.
    2. It does not triggers re render and update silently
